# BMAD Innovation Frameworks

Strategic frameworks for finding and capturing new value, from the BMAD Creative Intelligence Suite (CIS). Apply proven business and innovation frameworks to identify disruption opportunities and design sustainable competitive advantage.

## Framework Overview

| Framework | Primary Question |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Jobs-to-be-Done** | What are customers actually trying to accomplish? |
| **Blue Ocean Strategy** | Where is uncontested market space? |
| **Disruptive Innovation** | How can we attack from the edges? |
| **Business Model Canvas** | How do we create and capture value? |

## Jobs-to-be-Done

Customers "hire" products to do a job. Understanding the job reveals innovation opportunities product features miss.

### The Framework

1. **Identify the job** -- What is the customer trying to accomplish?
2. **Understand context** -- When, where, and with what constraints?
3. **Find struggles** -- Where do current solutions fail?
4. **Innovate on the job** -- How can the job be done better?

| Traditional Thinking | JTBD Thinking |
|---------------------|---------------|
| "Millennials want healthy snacks" | "People need to feel productive between meals" |
| "Add more protein bars" | "Make it easy to get sustained energy" |

## Blue Ocean Strategy

Do not compete in crowded "red oceans" -- create "blue oceans" of uncontested market space.

### The Four Actions Framework

1. **Eliminate** -- What factors should be removed?
2. **Reduce** -- What should be reduced below industry standard?
3. **Raise** -- What should be raised above industry standard?
4. **Create** -- What should be created that never existed?

| Red Ocean | Blue Ocean |
|-----------|-----------|
| Compete in existing market | Create new market |
| Beat the competition | Make competition irrelevant |
| Exploit existing demand | Create new demand |
| Align cost/value trade-off | Break the trade-off |

Example: Cirque du Soleil eliminated animals and star performers, reduced show variety, raised artistic and music quality, and created a new adult theatrical experience.

## Disruptive Innovation

Incumbents over-serve mainstream customers while overlooking segments. Disruptors enter ignored segments and improve.

### The Framework

1. **Identify overserved customers** -- Who gets more than they need?
2. **Find non-consumers** -- Who cannot use current solutions?
3. **Simplify** -- What can be removed while still delivering value?
4. **Improve rapidly** -- Move upmarket over time

| Disruption Type | Pattern |
|----------------|---------|
| **Low-end** | Serve customers incumbents ignore, improve upmarket |
| **New-market** | Serve non-consumers with simpler, more convenient solution |

Not all innovation is disruption. True disruption follows specific patterns. Most "disruptive" claims are just incremental improvement.

## Business Model Canvas

How you create and deliver value matters as much as what you create.

### The Nine Building Blocks

| Block | Question |
|-------|---------|
| **Value Proposition** | What value do we deliver? |
| **Customer Segments** | Who do we serve? |
| **Channels** | How do we reach them? |
| **Customer Relationships** | How do we interact? |
| **Revenue Streams** | How do we make money? |
| **Key Resources** | What assets do we need? |
| **Key Activities** | What must we do? |
| **Key Partnerships** | Who helps us? |
| **Cost Structure** | What does it cost? |

### Business Model Innovation Patterns

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Freemium** | Spotify, Dropbox |
| **Subscription** | Netflix, SaaS |
| **Marketplace** | Uber, Airbnb |
| **Razor & Blades** | Printers, Keurig |

## When to Use Which Framework

| Situation | Best Framework |
|-----------|---------------|
| Understanding customer motivation | Jobs-to-be-Done |
| Finding uncontested space | Blue Ocean Strategy |
| Analyzing competitive dynamics | Disruptive Innovation |
| Designing/reinventing business model | Business Model Canvas |

Frameworks combine well: Jobs-to-be-Done reveals the opportunity; Blue Ocean positions it; Business Model Canvas monetizes it.
