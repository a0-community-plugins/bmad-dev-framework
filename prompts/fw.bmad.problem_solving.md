# BMAD Problem Solving

Systematic problem diagnosis and root cause analysis from the BMAD Creative Intelligence Suite (CIS). Uses proven analytical frameworks to diagnose problems, identify root causes, and develop effective solutions.

## When to Use

- Facing a complex, persistent challenge
- Need to understand root causes before fixing symptoms
- Multiple solution options exist and you need to choose
- Problems recur despite previous attempts to fix them
- Issues span multiple systems or components

## When to Skip

- Well-understood problems with obvious solutions
- Simple, isolated bugs or issues
- Time-critical situations requiring immediate action

## Diagnostic Process

### Step 1: Describe the Problem

Be specific about symptoms. Good descriptions include measurable observations:

- "Users abandon checkout after entering payment info 40% of the time"
- "The database query takes 30 seconds when user count exceeds 1000"
- "Customer support tickets increased 300% after the last release"

Less effective: "Fix performance" (too vague), "The app is slow" (no specifics).

### Step 2: Diagnose

| Diagnostic Step | Goal |
|----------------|------|
| **Symptom analysis** | Separate what you see from what is causing it |
| **Boundary definition** | Understand where the problem lives and where it does not |
| **History review** | What changed, when, and what was attempted |

### Step 3: Apply Analytical Frameworks

| Framework | Best For |
|-----------|---------|
| **Five Whys** | Quick root cause drilling |
| **TRIZ** | Technical contradictions and inventive solutions |
| **Theory of Constraints** | System bottlenecks and flow |
| **Systems Thinking** | Interconnected, recurring issues |
| **Root Cause Analysis** | Comprehensive causal mapping |

### Step 4: Generate and Evaluate Solutions

1. **Diverge** -- Generate multiple solution approaches
2. **Evaluate** -- Assess pros, cons, and trade-offs
3. **Select** -- Choose based on effectiveness and feasibility
4. **Plan** -- Create implementation steps with risk mitigation

## Output Structure

A complete problem-solving report includes:

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| **Problem Statement** | Clearly defined challenge with symptoms |
| **Diagnosis** | Root cause analysis using selected frameworks |
| **Solution Options** | Multiple approaches with pros/cons |
| **Recommended Solution** | Best option with rationale |
| **Implementation Plan** | Actionable steps and timeline |
| **Risk Mitigation** | What could go wrong and how to prevent it |
| **Success Metrics** | How to measure effectiveness |

## Analytical Framework Details

### Five Whys

Ask "why" iteratively to drill down from symptoms to root causes. Typically 5 levels deep, but can be more or fewer.

### TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving)

Systematic approach to resolving technical contradictions. Identifies 40 inventive principles that can resolve common engineering trade-offs.

### Theory of Constraints

Every system has at least one constraint limiting throughput. Identify and exploit the constraint, subordinate everything else to it, then elevate it.

### Systems Thinking

Map feedback loops, delays, and interconnections. Look for leverage points where small changes produce large effects. Understand that cause and effect are often distant in time and space.

## Best Practices

- **Separate symptoms from causes** -- What you see is not the problem
- **Question assumptions** -- "Obvious" causes are often wrong
- **Think in systems** -- Problems often have multiple interconnected causes
- **Do not jump to solutions** -- Thorough diagnosis prevents solving the wrong problem
- **Do not accept first answers** -- Keep drilling
- **Do not ignore human factors** -- Process and people problems cause technical symptoms
