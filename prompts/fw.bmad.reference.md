# BMAD Method -- Complete Ecosystem Reference

The BMAD (BMad Agile Development) Method is a scale-adaptive agile AI-driven development framework. It combines a core methodology with creative intelligence and game development extensions into a unified ecosystem for taking projects from idea to ship.

## Ecosystem Components

### 1. BMAD-METHOD (Core)

The core agile methodology providing:

- **Role-based agents**: Analyst, Product Manager, Architect, UX Designer, Developer, Scrum Master, QA Engineer, Technical Writer
- **Phased workflows**: Analysis -> Planning -> Solutioning -> Implementation
- **Artifact-driven process**: Product briefs, PRDs, architecture docs, epics/stories, sprint tracking
- **Quality gates**: Implementation readiness checks, code review, retrospectives

### 2. BMAD Builder

Build and documentation tooling:

- **Changelog Social**: Generate social media announcements from changelog entries for Discord, Twitter, and LinkedIn
- **Add Doc**: Guided authoring for Diataxis-compliant documentation (tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, references)

### 3. Creative Intelligence Suite (CIS)

Six creative agents for innovation and problem-solving:

| Agent | Specialty |
|-------|-----------|
| **Carson** | Brainstorming Coach -- 36 techniques across 7 categories |
| **Maya** | Design Thinking Coach -- 5-phase human-centered design |
| **Victor** | Innovation Strategist -- JTBD, Blue Ocean, Disruptive Innovation, Business Model Canvas |
| **Dr. Quinn** | Problem Solver -- TRIZ, Theory of Constraints, Systems Thinking, Five Whys |
| **Sophia** | Storyteller -- 25 story frameworks and emotional beat crafting |
| **Caravaggio** | Presentation Master -- visual hierarchy and information design |

### 4. Game Dev Studio (BMGD)

Six game development agents covering the full production pipeline:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Samus Shepard** | Game Designer -- concept, GDD, narrative design |
| **Cloud Dragonborn** | Game Architect -- technical architecture, engine decisions |
| **Link Freeman** | Game Developer -- implementation, code review |
| **Max** | Game Scrum Master -- sprint planning, story management |
| **GLaDOS** | Game QA -- test frameworks, playtesting, performance |
| **Indie** | Solo Dev -- Quick Flow for indie/prototype development |

Supports 24 game type templates, three engines (Godot, Unity, Unreal), and both Quick Flow and Full Production workflows.

## Core BMAD Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Analysis
- Market research, domain research, technical research
- Product brief creation
- Brainstorming and ideation

### Phase 2: Planning
- PRD creation and validation
- UX design
- Epics and stories definition

### Phase 3: Solutioning
- Architecture creation
- Implementation readiness checks
- Technology selection

### Phase 4: Implementation
- Sprint planning and story creation
- Test-driven development
- Code review
- Retrospectives and course correction

## Key Principles

- **Scale-adaptive**: Works for solo developers through large teams
- **Artifact-driven**: Each phase produces concrete documents that feed the next
- **Quality-gated**: Readiness checks prevent proceeding with misaligned artifacts
- **AI-native**: Designed for AI-assisted development workflows
- **Role-specialized**: Each agent has deep expertise in their domain
- **Iterative**: Course correction and retrospectives built into the process
