# BMAD Design Thinking

Human-centered design process from the BMAD Creative Intelligence Suite (CIS). Guides through five iterative phases: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test.

## The Five Phases

Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that puts humans at the center. The phases are:

Empathize -> Define -> Ideate -> Prototype -> Test -> (back to Empathize)

Testing often reveals new empathy needs, restarting the cycle.

## Phase 1: Empathize

**Goal:** Understand the people you are designing for.

Build deep understanding of user needs, behaviors, attitudes, and contexts. Without this foundation, solutions solve the wrong problems.

| Activity | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **User interviews** | Hear directly from users in their own words |
| **Observation** | Watch what people actually do, not what they say |
| **Empathy mapping** | Organize observations into what users think, feel, see, do |
| **Journey mapping** | Map the complete user experience over time |

Key emphasis: Design WITH users, not FOR them. Validation through real human interaction beats every assumption.

## Phase 2: Define

**Goal:** Frame a user-centered problem statement.

Synthesize empathy research into a clear, actionable problem statement.

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Point of View (POV)** | User-centered problem statement |
| **How Might We (HMW) questions** | Reframe problems as opportunities |
| **Problem statements** | Clear articulation of what needs solving |

Example POV: "Busy parents need a way to feel connected to their children's education because current communication is scattered and time-consuming."

## Phase 3: Ideate

**Goal:** Generate a wide range of solutions.

Create quantity and diversity of options. Divergent thinking prevents converging on the first obvious solution.

| Approach | How It Works |
|----------|-------------|
| **Brainstorming** | Generate many ideas rapidly |
| **Sketching** | Visual thinking explores beyond words |
| **Storyboards** | Narrative exploration of user experience |
| **Worst ideas** | Flip to reverse constraints |

Key rule: Diverge before converging. Generate 50+ ideas before evaluating any.

## Phase 4: Prototype

**Goal:** Make ideas tangible and testable.

Prototypes are rough representations that communicate the essence of an idea. They are not about polish -- they are about learning.

| Fidelity | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Paper sketches** | Early exploration, quick iterations |
| **Wireframes** | Structure and layout, low-detail |
| **Click-throughs** | Interaction flow without visuals |
| **Wizard of Oz** | Manual simulation of digital features |

Build to learn, not to impress. A paper prototype tested today beats a perfect prototype built too late.

## Phase 5: Test

**Goal:** Validate solutions with real users.

Testing reveals whether prototypes solve the real problem. Negative results are valuable learning.

| Activity | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Usability testing** | Observe users interacting with prototype |
| **Feedback capture** | Hear what works and what does not |
| **Assumption validation** | Confirm or refute design hypotheses |
| **Iteration planning** | Identify what to change next |

## Non-Linear Progress

| Common Pattern | What Happens |
|---------------|-------------|
| Test reveals empathy gaps | Back to Phase 1 for deeper understanding |
| Ideate produces weak concepts | Back to Phase 2 for better framing |
| Prototype uncovers new insights | Back to Phase 1 or 2 with fresh perspective |

## Design Thinking vs. Traditional Development

| Aspect | Design Thinking | Traditional |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Starting point** | User needs and context | Business requirements or technology |
| **Process** | Iterative, non-linear | Linear, gated |
| **Risk** | Fail fast, learn early | Fail late, expensive |
| **Output** | User-validated solutions | Feature-complete products |

## When Design Thinking Works Best

| Situation | Why It Helps |
|-----------|-------------|
| New product development | Ensures product-market fit |
| Complex user experiences | Maps complete journeys, not touchpoints |
| Cross-functional alignment | Shared empathy builds team consensus |
| Innovation opportunities | Uncovers unmet needs not obvious from data |
