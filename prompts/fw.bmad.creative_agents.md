## CIS Design Principles

### 1. Specialized Agents
Each agent embodies a creative discipline with deep expertise in that domain.

### 2. Curated Technique Libraries
CIS draws from proven traditions: design facilitation, design thinking, strategic innovation, problem-solving methodologies, and narrative theory.

### 3. Interactive Facilitation
CIS workflows guide through questions rather than generating outputs. This preserves your context, judgment, and learning.

### 4. Diverge-Converge Structure
All CIS workflows follow the same rhythm: Diverge (generate many options, expand solution space), then Converge (select and refine, move to action). Many creative failures happen from converging too quickly.
